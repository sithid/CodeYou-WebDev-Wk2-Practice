You can also use this as an opportunity to take what you've learned so far and apply it to something you are passionate about.

# Project - Them Kitties
A small website called 'Them Kitties' that has a photo carousel (sorta).

This is a small project to help me practice what ive learned/what I know about HTML/CSS/Javascript up to this point. This allowed me to practice dynamically creating elements through javascript and setting their different attributes and classes.
